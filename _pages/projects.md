## BIRD Leaderboard: #1 in Text-to-SQL Benchmark

**Achievement**: Led IBM Granite Text-to-SQL models to **first place in both tracks** of the prestigious BIRD (BIg Bench for LaRge-scale Database Grounded Text-to-SQL Evaluation) leaderboard.

**Challenge**: BIRD features over **12,751 question-SQL pairs** across **95 databases** from **37 professional fields**, emphasizing accuracy and execution efficiency.

**Why It Matters**:
- **Outperformed GPT-4 and GPT-4o** with smaller, more efficient models (Granite-20B and Granite-34B)
- **Held #1 position for months** against intense competition
- Sparked renewed interest from major players: **Google, Alibaba, ByteDance**
- Demonstrated IBM's leadership in practical, production-ready LLM applications

**Technical Approach**:
- Fine-tuned models for three critical tasks:
  - Schema linking (connecting natural language to database schema)
  - Content linking (mapping to actual data values)
  - SQL code generation (producing accurate, executable queries)
- Developed novel training datasets from open-source and enterprise use cases
- Implemented advanced reasoning capabilities

**Recognition**:
- IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award - 2025
- IBM Research Accomplishments (A-level) - 2024
- Featured at THINK'24 (IBM's flagship conference)
- Deployed on BAM and Watsonx.ai platforms
