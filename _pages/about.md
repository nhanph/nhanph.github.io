I am a 3rd year PhD student in Operations Research in Department of Statistics and Operations Research at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am currently working on stochastic methods for non-convex optimization with applications in machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning under supervision by Dr. Quoc Tran-Dinh.

I come from Vietnam where I had my bachelor in Computer Engineering from Deparment of Computer Science and Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (Bach Khoa University). During my undergrad, I was a member of BKIT Hardware Club and participated in the Vietnam Robot Contest under BK4/BKIT Number One team in 2013.

My hobbies are travelling with my wife and explore new places.
