I am a Staff Research Scientist at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY. I finished my PhD in Operations Research in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2021 under supervision by Dr. Quoc Tran-Dinh.

## Current Research

My current research focuses on **Large Language Models (LLMs) for enterprise data management applications**, particularly building end-to-end Text-to-SQL systems. I lead the development of NL2Insights, an automated pipeline that powers flagship IBM products including watsonx.data intelligence, BI Assistant, and Process Mining. Our system has generated over **200,000 SQL queries across 1,000+ databases** at enterprise scale.

## Recent Achievements

- **IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award** (2026): For NL2Insights Impacting Products and Clients
- **#1 on BIRD Leaderboard** (2024): Led IBM Granite Text-to-SQL models to first place in both tracks of the prestigious BIRD benchmark, outperforming larger models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o
- **IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award** (2025): For achieving first place on the BIRD leaderboard
- **IBM Growth Award** (2025): For advancing Text2SQL service within watsonx.data intelligence
- **Multiple IBM Research Accomplishments** (2024-2025): For NL2Insights product adoption and BIRD leaderboard success
- **Production Impact**: Enabled multilingual Text2SQL capabilities across all IBM Cloud and AWS regions

I also continue research on stochastic optimization methods for machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.

## Background

I come from Vietnam where I had my bachelor in Computer Engineering from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (Bach Khoa University). During my undergrad, I was a member of BKIT Hardware Club and participated in the Vietnam Robot Contest under BK4/BKIT Number One team in 2013.

My hobbies are travelling with my wife and exploring new places.
